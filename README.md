## Bit Compiler

Bit compiler is the compiling module of Bit, Hello World!'s utility mod. Bit compiler is a fork of Discord Compiler Bot, an open-source Discord bot that allows people to compile code safely. The differences between Bit Compiler and Discord Compiler Bot are small, with the only major difference being that only the compile command is implemented. All credit goes to the developers of Discord Compiler Bot.
